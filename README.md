**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
In order to implement user needs I need to understand the requirements, expectations, and goals of the users. Before I can translate these into a functional product, I need user stories because it turns the user requirements in a simple, concise, and understandable format. This helps break down complex requirements into manageable tasks and ensures I remain focused on delivering a quality product to the user.


**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
I approach developing programs by using a structured and iterative process like Agile, which focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The agile processes I hope to incorporate into future work is using regular feedback, continuous improvement, and adaptive planning. With these, I can deliver high-quality products to the customer. 


**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Just like playing on a sports team, being a good team member in software development involves using productive communication, collaboration, sharing knowledge and supporting others. A good team member is active in team meetings, provides constructive feedback, and respects the different perspectives.
